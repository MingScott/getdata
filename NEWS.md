# getdata 0.1.0.9001 (2023-03-29)

* Add new `bind_location_text_col()` and `between_date_range()` functions.
* Export `str_trim_squish_across()` function.
* Add `lifecycle`,  `vctrs`, `tidyselect`, and `withr` to Imports (and remove `purrr`).
* Update `get_osm_id()` to handle vector id values.

# getdata 0.1.0.9000 (2022-12-23)

* First development version! getdata works well and code coverage is above 60% but additional refactoring is expected to increase consistency of syntax across functions and overall performance.
